# TeleportDashDemo

Teleport dash is brand new open source puzzle platformer game


Basic idea of the video game is following, you shoot projectiles/orbs and when you press certain input you teleport to them and gain them back again. Tthe orbs can have different types. For example some may teleport you staticaly and some may give you momentum, some may reflect form objects some may destroy upon collision.

Proof of concept video(the gameplay is far from polished in it :))
